Ref:
When you run two or more containers in the same Docker network,
it means that these containers are connected to the same logical network,
allowing them to communicate with each other.

Docker provides a network isolation mechanism, and containers
within the same network can easily discover and communicate with each other using their container names as hostnames.


# Create a custom network
docker network create my_network

# Run containers in the same network
docker run --network=my_network --name container1 image1
docker run --network=my_network --name container2 image2


Example with loan_service we crate a custom network name 'local_service'

# docker network create local_server
